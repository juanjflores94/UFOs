# UFOs


## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The first webpage that we created only provided us with the ability to filter by date. We wanted the ability to filter by more than just the date. After the changes made to the website page we can now filter by city, state, country, and shape.


## Results

During our first webpage we could only filter by date. With the new updated verision, users will be able to filter data much easier. The webpage has 5 different filters to use now which makes sorting that data much easier.

Here you can see we filtered the data using the state filter. We filtered by the state of Oregon.

## Summary of Analysis
Here are two recommendations to improve the webpage.

Create multiple pages for the entry results. As the total number of entries in this list increases, this webpage will become clunky and difficult to scroll thorugh so many entries. Creating a button that allows the user to choose how many results are shown per page. When I see these on other websites it makes searching much easier.

Another recommendation would be a sorting button. As the number of results grow, users may want an ability to sort the results to see more relevant data. Examples include sorting by Date (ascending/descending) or by City Name (A to Z, Z to A).
